This guide can be used to start using PyIDS in no time but probably better options for your system could be found looking through the full documentation.

1) Download the tar.gz in the directory that you want to have the "pyids/" dir, ie. /usr/sbin

2) Extract the sources:
   
    $ tar xzvf pyids.tar.gz
   
   The "pyids/" directory will be created.

3) Edit the file config-example.xml to indicate the options for your system and save it to config.xml
    
    $ vim config-example.xml

4) Create the checksum database. It will take some time.
  
    # python main.py -v -g

5) Execute PyIDS for the first time with all checks to test the configuration. It will take some time because checksum comprobation.

    # python main.py -v -m -a -u -p -c -e root@localhost
 
6) Now you have some results that should be fine tunne correcting the config file.
   
7) If you don't get any error you can add PyIDS to crontab with the -d flag:

    # crontab -e
    */5 * * * * /usr/sbin/pyids/main.py -f  /usr/sbin/pyids/config.xml -d
